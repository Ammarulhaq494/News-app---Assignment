# News-app---Assignment

1) This App is made using Swift programming language Using Xcode version 15.0. For design I have used storyboards. 

2) The bundle identifier of this app "com.avrioc.News-App---Avrioc-Assignment" is rejistered to my personal apple developer account. To Run this app you need to modify or change the bundle identifier. 

3) News App is made using MVVM (Model View View Model) Architecture. Structure of App : 
   *) App has two View controllers (Main View Controller) and (Detail View Controller) and assiocated Model and ViewModel class. 
   
4) This App only includes one frmaework dependency "KingFisher". This library is used to load Image from URL and show in News view controller and detail view controller. 

5) I have used the "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/viewed/1.json?" api with Api key got from Newyork dev portal to fetch the news articals from the server in json format.
